-- Grants, applied last.

-- 0001 sets ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES so anything created after it is granted
-- automatically, but default privileges only ever apply to objects created
-- *afterwards* and only for the role that set them. This sweeps everything
-- that actually exists, so the outcome does not depend on which order someone
-- ran the files in or which role they were connected as.
--
-- Safe to re-run. Safe to run after adding a table — in fact, run it again.
--
-- To be clear about what this does and does not open up: PostgREST cannot see
-- a schema it has no USAGE on, and cannot see a table it has no SELECT on, so
-- these grants are what make the API work at all. They are not what decides
-- who sees which rows. That is Row Level Security, which is enabled on every
-- table in this schema — and the tables holding encrypted keys and token
-- hashes have RLS enabled with no policies whatsoever, so `anon` and
-- `authenticated` reaching them come back with nothing. Only the service role
-- bypasses RLS, and that key never leaves the server.
